# SIEM Security Monitoring & Threat Detection Lab

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a comprehensive Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution using **Graylog**, **OpenSearch**, and **MongoDB**. The system processes real-time security events, detects sophisticated cyber attacks, and provides security dashboards for visualising security operations.

##  Architecture

```
Web Traffic â†’ Apache Logs â†’ rsyslog â†’ Graylog â†’ OpenSearch â†’ Security Dashboards
                                    â†“
                            Detection Rules & Alerts
```

**Technology Stack:**
- **SIEM Platform:** Graylog 4.3.x
- **Search Engine:** OpenSearch
- **Database:** MongoDB 4.4.18
- **Log Sources:** Apache Web Server, Custom Applications
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu (VirtualBox VM)

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Achievements

### âœ… Multi-Source Log Ingestion
- Configured **Apache web server** log collection
- Implemented **rsyslog forwarding** to Graylog
- Set up **real-time log processing** pipeline
- Created **custom application log** formats (JSON)

### âœ… Advanced Threat Detection Rules
Developed **8 sophisticated detection rules** covering:
**classify_malicious_user_agents_raw** - Detection of malicious user agents
2. **classify_normal_traffic** - Classification of legitimate web traffic
3. **classify_normal_user_agents_raw** - Identification and classification of legitimate user agents
4. **detect_directory_traversal** - Path traversal and file inclusion attack detection
5. **detect_scanner_activity** - Vulnerability scanner detection
6. **detect_sql_injection** - Advanced SQL injection  detection
7. **detect_web_reconnaissance** - Web application reconnaissance detection
8. **detect_xss_attack** - Cross-site scripting (XSS) payload detection and analysis

Created **comprehensive security dashboard** with **4 key visualisations**:

#### 1. Top Attack Types (Pie Chart)
- Visual distribution of different attack categories
- Proportional representation of SQL injection, XSS, directory traversal, and reconnaissance attempts
- Real-time attack type classification and trending

#### 2. Most Requested URLs (Bar Chart)
- Horizontal bar chart showing frequently targeted endpoints
- Identification of high-risk application paths
- Attack surface analysis and vulnerability hotspot detection

#### 3. Most Used User Agents (Data Table)
- Detailed breakdown of user agent strings and their frequency
- Identification of legitimate browsers vs. automated security tools
- Classification of normal traffic vs. malicious scanning tools

#### 4. Total Web Requests (Single Number)
- Real-time counter of total HTTP requests processed
- Overall system activity monitoring
- Baseline establishment for traffic volume analysis
